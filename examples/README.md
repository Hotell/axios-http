# Examples

`axios-http` is distributed with a few examples in its source code. Most of these examples are also on `CodeSandbox`.

All examples use `parcel-js` as this is the easiest way how to boot any demo app ;).

## swapi-people app

Run the [Example app](./swapi-people-app) example:

```
git clone https://github.com/hotell/axios-http.git

cd axios-http/examples/swapi-people-app
yarn install
yarn start
```

Or check out the [sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/Hotell/axios-http/tree/master/examples/swapi-people-app).

This simple app demonstrates various `axios-http` library features like:
